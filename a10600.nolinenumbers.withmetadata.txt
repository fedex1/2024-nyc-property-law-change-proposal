   annual taxes at such rates that the revenue projected is no more than
   one per centum greater than the revenue of the previous year, and that

     7. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, in a city

   roll completed in two thousand twenty-five, for a class one property,
   the assessor shall compute any increase in tax liability due to an
   increase in assessed value as a phase-in pursuant to the provisions of
   this subdivision. The annual tax during each taxable year of the phase-
   in period shall be computed as follows:
     (i) multiply the sales-based valuation of the property in the first
   taxable year of the phase-in by the new tax rate;
     (ii) subtract from the result obtained in subparagraph (i) of this
   paragraph the annual tax for the final taxable year before the phase-in
   period;
     (iii) divide the result obtained in subparagraph (ii) of this para-
   graph by five;
     (iv) add the result obtained in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph
   to the annual tax for the previous year;
     (v) multiply the most recent sales-based valuation by the new tax
   rate;
     (vi) subtract the result obtained in subparagraph (i) of this para-
   graph from the result obtained in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph;
   and
     (vii) add the result obtained in subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph
   to the result obtained in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph.
     (b)   For taxable years during the phase-in period, the amount
   prescribed by this subdivision for a property owner qualified for the
   circuit breaker abatement pursuant to section four hundred twenty-five-b
   of this chapter shall be computed to include such reduction.
     (c) If a class one property is sold during the phase-in period, the
   annual tax for the first taxable year after its sale shall be computed
   as follows:
     (i) Multiply the sales-based valuation of the property in the first
   year of the phase-in by the new tax rate;
     (ii) Subtract from the result obtained in subparagraph (i) of this
   paragraph the annual tax for the final taxable year before the phase-in
   period;
     (iii) Divide the result obtained in subparagraph (ii) of this para-
   graph by five;
     (iv) Multiply the result obtained in subparagraph (iii) of this para-
   graph by the number of taxable years remaining in the phase-in period,
   including the one for which this annual tax is computed; and
     (v) Add the result obtained in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph to
   the result obtained in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.
     Thereafter, the annual tax shall be the sales-based valuation multi-
   plied by the new tax rate. The amount prescribed by this paragraph
   for a property owner qualified for the circuit breaker abatement pursu-
   ant to section four hundred twenty-five-b of this chapter shall be
   computed to include such reduction.

   lation of one million or more, any class one property shall be exempt
   from taxation and special ad valorem levies as provided in subdivision
   two of this section.
     (b) To qualify for exemption pursuant to this section, the property
   must be a class one property. If the property is not eligible but a
   portion of the property is partially used by a qualifying owner as a
   primary residence, that portion which is so used shall be entitled to
   the exemption provided by this section.
     (c) The property must serve as the primary residence of one or more of
   the owners thereof.
     (d) For purposes of the exemption authorized by this section, the
   parcel's affiliated income may be less than five hundred thousand
   dollars. As used in this section, the term "affiliated income" shall
   mean the combined income of all of the owners of the parcel who resided
   primarily thereon on the applicable taxable status date, and of any

   apartment corporation in which a tenant-stockholder of such corporation

   shares of stock in such corporation as determined by its or their
   proportional relationship to the total outstanding stock of the corpo-
   ration, including that owned by the corporation, shall be deemed to be
   vested in such tenant-stockholder. That proportion of the assessment of
   such real property owned by a cooperative apartment corporation deter-
   mined by the relationship of such real property vested in such tenant-
   stockholder to such entire parcel and the buildings thereon owned by
   such cooperative apartment corporation in which such tenant-stockholder
   resides shall be subject to exemption from taxation pursuant to this
   section and any exemption so granted shall be credited by the appropri-
   ate taxing authority against the assessed valuation of such real proper-
   ty; the reduction in real property taxes realized thereby shall be cred-
   ited by the cooperative apartment corporation against the amount of such
   taxes otherwise payable by or chargeable to such tenant-stockholder.
     2. The homestead property tax exemption provided by this section shall
   be as follows:

        ANNUAL INCOME                      PERCENTAGE FAIR MARKET VALUE

        Over $450,000 up to $475,000                 4 per centum
        Over $475,000 up to $500,000                 2 per centum

     3. The term "income" as used in this section shall mean the "adjusted
   gross income" for federal income tax purposes as reported on the appli-
   cant's federal or state income tax return for the applicable income tax
   year, subject to any subsequent amendments or revisions, reduced by
   distributions, to the extent included in federal adjusted gross income,
   received from an individual retirement account and an individual retire-
     A. 10600                            7

   ment annuity; provided that if no such return was filed for the applica-
   ble income tax year, "income" shall mean the adjusted gross income that
   would have been so reported if such a return had been filed. Provided
   further, that where an income-eligibility determination is wholly or
   partly based upon the income of one or more individuals who did not file
   a return for the applicable income tax year, then in order for the
   application to be considered complete, each such individual must file a
   statement with the department showing the source or sources of their
   income for that income tax year, and the amount or amounts thereof, that
   would have been reported on such a return if one had been filed. Such
   statement shall be filed at such time, and in such form and manner, as
   may be prescribed by the department, and shall be subject to the secrecy
   provisions of the tax law to the same extent that a personal income tax
   return would be. The department shall make such forms and instructions
   available for the filing of such statements. The assessor shall upon the
   request of a taxpayer assist such taxpayer in the filing of the state-
   ment with the department.
     4. Any exemption provided by this section shall be computed after all
   other partial exemptions allowed by law, excluding the school tax relief
   (STAR) exemption authorized by section four hundred twenty-five of this
   title, have been subtracted from the total amount assessed; provided,
   however, that no parcel may receive an exemption for the same PILOT or
   municipal tax purpose pursuant to both this section and section four
   hundred sixty-seven of this title.
     5. The commissioner may require such exemption to be granted upon
   application by the owner or all of the owners of the real property on a
   form prescribed and made available by the commissioner. The applicant
   shall furnish such information as the commissioner shall require. Appli-
   cations for the exemption authorized pursuant to this section shall be
   considered timely filed if they are filed on or before the fifteenth day
   of March of the appropriate year.
     6. It shall be the responsibility of the commissioner to annually
   determine all income standards pursuant to this section, to cause notice
   thereof to be published in the state register, to disseminate notice
   thereof to assessors, and such other parties as deemed appropriate.
     ยง 2. This act shall take effect immediately.
