# 2024-nyc-property-law-change-proposal

If anyone here would like to review these changes I extracted the bill and put it in a git repository.
See 
[PDF of bill] (a10600.pdf)

and

[Text of bill] (a10600.nolinenumbers.withmetadata.txt)

It would be nice to understand the bill and review all of it's changes and consequences.

## A question from a reddit user

See https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1btv9l6/comment/kxogzb0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

but this is still confusing because park slope has been well off for a long time! since the 90s. even Williamsburg and lic have been pretty much rich neighbourhoods since 2015, it's not like it just started yesterday. east ny is still trash, where you can actually get a house for under 500k. how do neighborhoods with million dollar homes for the last 10-20 yrs have lower tax bills? i know it takes time but it's been like one, two generations at this point. new build condos get reassessed literally within a year.

### Answer

It all goes back to 1981 and what was the assessed value of the home for class 1 property (1 to 3 family homes)

Many Park Slope homes were built in the 1890's or near and they kept their assessed value from the time they were built.

In 1981, the S7000A bill passed and allowed for effectively a 4% increase limit on the assessed value. Plus a class share system that limited the percent of the total levy that the class 1 property could be taxed.

The important word is "limit" East New York market values did not rise as fast as Park Slope and in fact most of North Brooklyn.

The law only limits the annual increase in assessed value. It did not and could not control the "market value"

This property tax law is up for revision now with a proposed removal of many of the limits.

It would be nice to get a few persons together to actually create a calculator to show the effect of these changes on real properties and people.

I wonder why we do not require such a process when making tax law changes. It appears the taxpayers are the last to know. :(
